        their interactions with the app. This agriculture application is designed to provide farmers, agronomists, and
        other stakeholders with valuable insights, tools, and resources to improve agricultural productivity,
        sustainability, and efficiency. The app offers various features such as weather forecasting, crop management
        advice, pest control recommendations, marketplace connections, and more. Users must ensure they use the
        application responsibly and legally, respecting local agricultural laws and guidelines. Unauthorized use,

        insights, weather forecasts, and crop recommendations, it does not guarantee absolute accuracy, and they should
        consult professional agricultural experts when making critical farming decisions. The app operates under an “as

        applicable. The Terms of Use may change over time based on company policies, legal requirements, and user
        feedback. Continued usage of the app after such modifications implies user acceptance of updated terms. In case
        of disputes regarding app services, usage rights, or payments, resolutions will be governed by the laws of mp kisan.com, with arbitration or mediation used when applicable. By agreeing to these terms, users acknowledge
        their responsibility to engage with the app ethically, ensuring that their contributions, reviews, or
